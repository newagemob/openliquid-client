# Data Visualization and Organization

The most effective and efficient methods of data visualization and organization for human review and to feed machine learning training pipelines are:
* Data visualization: Visualization is a powerful tool to explore data and identify patterns and trends. Some effective visualization tools include Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and Bokeh. These tools allow you to create a wide range of charts, graphs, and plots, including line charts, bar charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps.
* Data organization: Proper organization of data is critical for efficient analysis and modeling. Some effective methods of data organization include using Pandas DataFrames, CSV files, and SQL databases. Pandas DataFrames allow you to manipulate and analyze data using a variety of functions, while CSV files and SQL databases provide efficient storage and retrieval of large datasets.
* Feature engineering: Feature engineering is the process of selecting and transforming relevant features from raw data to improve the performance of machine learning models. Some effective feature engineering techniques include one-hot encoding, scaling, and normalization.
* Data augmentation: Data augmentation is the process of creating new training samples by applying various transformations to existing data. Some effective data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, and scaling images.


# Examples

1. Cleaning and Preprocessing Data with Pandas:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Import data
df = pd.read_csv('stock_data.csv')

# Remove missing values
df = df.dropna()

# Convert date column to datetime format
df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'])

# Filter data for a specific time period
start_date = pd.to_datetime('2022-01-01')
end_date = pd.to_datetime('2022-12-31')
df_filtered = df.loc[(df['date'] >= start_date) & (df['date'] <= end_date)]

# Save cleaned and preprocessed data to a new csv file
df_filtered.to_csv('cleaned_stock_data.csv', index=False)
```


2. Data Visualization with Matplotlib:

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Import data
df = pd.read_csv('cleaned_stock_data.csv')

# Plot stock price over time
plt.plot(df['date'], df['price'])
plt.title('Stock Price over Time')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Price')
plt.show()
```


3. Interactive Data Visualization with Plotly:

```python
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px

# Import data
df = pd.read_csv('cleaned_stock_data.csv')

# Create interactive plot of stock price over time
fig = px.line(df, x='date', y='price', title='Stock Price over Time')
fig.show()
```


4. Organizing Data with SQL:

```python
import sqlite3
import pandas as pd

# Create SQLite database and connect to it
conn = sqlite3.connect('stock_data.db')

# Import data into SQLite database
df = pd.read_csv('cleaned_stock_data.csv')
df.to_sql('stock_data', conn, if_exists='replace', index=False)

# Query the database to select specific data
query = '''
SELECT date, AVG(price) AS avg_price
FROM stock_data
GROUP BY date
HAVING AVG(price) > 100
ORDER BY date
'''
df_filtered = pd.read_sql(query, conn)

# Save filtered data to a new csv file
df_filtered.to_csv('filtered_stock_data.csv', index=False)
```


5. Dimensionality Reduction with PCA:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

# Import data
df = pd.read_csv('cleaned_stock_data.csv')

# Define features and target variable
X = df.drop('price', axis=1)
y = df['price']

# Apply PCA to reduce dimensionality of features
pca = PCA(n_components=2)
X_pca = pca.fit_transform(X)

# Plot first two principal components
plt.scatter(X_pca[:,0], X_pca[:,1], c=y)
plt.title('PCA plot of stock data')
plt.xlabel('Principal Component 1')
plt.ylabel('Principal Component 2')
plt.show()
```


6. Time Series Analysis with Prophet:

```python
import pandas as pd
from fbprophet import Prophet

# Import data
df = pd.read_csv('cleaned_stock_data.csv')
df = df[['date', 'price']]
df = df.rename(columns={'date':'ds', 'price':'y'})

# Fit Prophet model to time series data
model = Prophet()
model.fit(df)

# Generate predictions for future time periods
future = model.make_future_dataframe(periods=365)
forecast = model.predict(future)

# Plot forecasted values
model.plot(forecast, xlabel='Date', ylabel='Price')
plt.title('Forecasted Stock Prices')
plt.show()
```


# Utility Definitions

* Cleaning and Preprocessing Data with Pandas: This technique is primarily used for data organization, as it involves manipulating and filtering data to prepare it for analysis.
* Data Visualization with Matplotlib: This technique is primarily used for data visualization, as it involves creating visualizations of data to better understand patterns and trends.
* Interactive Data Visualization with Plotly: Like Matplotlib, this technique is primarily used for data visualization, but it adds the extra feature of creating interactive visualizations that allow users to explore data more fully.
* Organizing Data with SQL: This technique is primarily used for data organization, as it involves organizing data in a database format for efficient querying and analysis.
* Dimensionality Reduction with PCA: This technique can be used for both data organization and visualization, as it involves reducing the number of features in a dataset to simplify analysis and potentially create visualizations of the reduced-dimensional data.
* Time Series Analysis with Prophet: This technique is primarily used for data visualization, as it involves creating time series forecasts and visualizing the predicted values over time. However, it also involves organizing time series data in a specific format for analysis, so it could also be considered a technique for data organization.
