# Statistical Modeling

There are several effective statistical modeling methods that can be used in an algorithmic trading workflow. Some of the most commonly used methods are:
* Time series analysis: Time series analysis is a statistical technique that is used to analyze time-dependent data. In an algorithmic trading workflow, time series analysis can be used to forecast stock prices and identify trends and patterns in the market.
* Regression analysis: Regression analysis is a statistical technique that is used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. In an algorithmic trading workflow, regression analysis can be used to predict stock prices based on various economic indicators.
* Machine learning: Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that involves training models to make predictions based on data. In an algorithmic trading workflow, machine learning can be used to identify profitable trading opportunities and develop trading strategies.
* Bayesian analysis: Bayesian analysis is a statistical technique that is used to update beliefs based on new evidence. In an algorithmic trading workflow, Bayesian analysis can be used to update trading strategies based on new market data.


# Examples

1. Hypothesis Testing with SciPy:

```python
import pandas as pd
from scipy.stats import ttest_ind

# Import data
df = pd.read_csv('cleaned_stock_data.csv')

# Separate data into two groups based on a certain feature
group1 = df[df['feature'] == 'A']['price']
group2 = df[df['feature'] == 'B']['price']

# Conduct two-sample t-test to determine if there is a significant difference in means between the two groups
t_stat, p_val = ttest_ind(group1, group2)

# Print results
print('t-statistic:', t_stat)
print('p-value:', p_val)
```


2. Regression analysis with StatsModels:

```python
import pandas as pd
import statsmodels.api as sm

# Import data
df = pd.read_csv('cleaned_stock_data.csv')

# Define target variable and features
X = df[['feature1', 'feature2']]
y = df['price']

# Add constant term for intercept
X = sm.add_constant(X)

# Fit multiple linear regression model
model = sm.OLS(y, X).fit()

# Print summary of model statistics
print(model.summary())
```


3. Correlation analysis with NumPy:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Import data
df = pd.read_csv('cleaned_stock_data.csv')

# Calculate Pearson correlation coefficient between two features
corr_coef = np.corrcoef(df['feature1'], df['feature2'])[0, 1]

# Print result
print('Correlation coefficient:', corr_coef)
```


4. Clustering with Scikit-Learn:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

# Import data
df = pd.read_csv('cleaned_stock_data.csv')

# Define features for clustering
X = df[['feature1', 'feature2']]

# Fit KMeans clustering model with k=3 clusters
model = KMeans(n_clusters=3).fit(X)

# Get cluster labels for each data point
labels = model.labels_

# Plot data points with different colors for each cluster
plt.scatter(X['feature1'], X['feature2'], c=labels)
plt.xlabel('Feature 1')
plt.ylabel('Feature 2')
plt.title('KMeans Clustering with k=3')
plt.show()
```


5. Time series analysis with StatsModels:

```python
import pandas as pd
import statsmodels.api as sm

# Import data
df = pd.read_csv('cleaned_stock_data.csv')
df = df[['date', 'price']]
df = df.rename(columns={'date':'ds', 'price':'y'})

# Fit ARIMA model to time series data
model = sm.tsa.ARIMA(df['y'], order=(1,1,1))
results = model.fit()

# Generate predictions for future time periods
forecast = results.forecast(steps=365)

# Plot forecasted values
plt.plot(df['ds'], df['y'], label='Observed')
plt.plot(forecast.index, forecast.values, label='Forecast')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Price')
plt.title('ARIMA Forecast of Stock Prices')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```
